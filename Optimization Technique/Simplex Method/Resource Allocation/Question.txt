A firm that produces two products has limitations on its machine and labour time. There are 240
hours of machine time and 300 hours of labour time available during the production period. A unit of the first product requires 4 hours of
machine time and 3 hours of labour time. The second product takes 6
and 8 hours of machine and labour time, respectively. A unit of product 1 and product 2 generates profits of 10.00and12.00, respectively.
The economic problem is to find the levels of products 1 and 2 that
maximize profit and allocate economic resources efficiently
