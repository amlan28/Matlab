A patient in a hospital is required to have at least 84 units
of drug A and 120 units of drug B each day. Each gram of substance
M contains 10 units of drug A and 8 units of drug B, and each gram
of substance N contains 2 units of drug A and 4 units of drug B. Now
suppose that both M and N contain an undesirable drug C, 3 units per
gram in M and 1 unit per gram in N. How many grams of substances
M and N should be mixed to meet the minimum daily requirements at
the same time minimize the intake of drug C? How many units of the
undesirable drug C will be in this mixture?
