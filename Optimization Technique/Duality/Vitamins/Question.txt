In this problem, a patient visits the doctor to get treatment for ill
health. The doctor examines the patient and advises him to consume
at least 40 units of vitamin A and 50 units of vitamin B daily for a specified time period. He also advises the patient that to get vitamin A and
vitamin B he has to drink tonic X and tonic Y that have both vitamin
A and vitamin B in a proportion. One unit of tonic X consists 2 units of
vitamin A and 3 units of vitamin B and one unit of tonic Y consists of 4
units of vitamin A and 2 units of vitamin B. These tonics are available
in medical shops at a cost of Rs.3.00 and Rs.2.50 per unit of X and Y
respectively. Now the problem of patient is how much of X and how
much of Y is to be purchased from the shop to minimise the total cost
and at the same time he can get required amounts of vitamins A and B.
