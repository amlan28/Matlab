An animal feed company must produce 200
kg of a mixture consisting of ingredients X1, and X2 daily. X1 cost Rs.
3 per kg and X2 Rs. 8 per kg. Not more than 80 kg of X1 can be
used, and at least 60 kg of X2 must be used. Find how much of each
ingredient should be used if the company wants to minimise cost.
