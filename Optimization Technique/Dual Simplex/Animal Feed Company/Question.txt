An animal food company at least produce 200kg of ingredients x1 and
x2 daily. x1 costs Rs.3 per kg and x2 Rs. 8 per kg. Not more than 80 kg
of x1 can be used and at least 60kg of x2 must be used. Formulate the
LP model to minimize the cost and compute the optimal cost. (Hint:
Let x1 and x2 are the ingredients in the mixture as expressed in kg.)
